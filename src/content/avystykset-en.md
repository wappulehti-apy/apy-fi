# Äpy-Gränts

**Äpy supports manifestations of the Aalto spirit!** Do you have a great idea or project in mind? Read below on how you can apply for support in the form of gränts:

**A gränt is financial aid** for individual projects, spontaneous initiatives, or more permanent needs. Any entity within the Aalto community can apply for a gränt. We particularly want to support causes that bring joy to as many people as possible. Applications are processed at the meetings of the Finnish Äpy Magazines Association's board (Suomen Äpy-Lehtien liitto ry).

**The amount of the gränt depends on the supported cause.** The size of the gränt we award can range from zero to over a thousand euros. The gränted amount depends on how broadly we feel the project will bring joy, confusion, or amusement to the community, how Äpy can be visible in the project, and what portion of the total project costs the gränt covers.
Apply for a gränt by sending an informal (preferably at least partially written) application to **avystykset [at] apy.fi.**

**Your application should include:**

- Applicant's contact information
- Project description
- The amount applied and its purpose
- Ideas for Äpy’s visibility in the project
- Possible other funding sources, their contributions / requested amounts

**Your application should not include:**

- An audio recording longer than 48 minutes (video is okay)
- Your bank credentials
